The main objects in the video are the metallic can and the tool. The can is made of a smooth, reflective material, likely metal, with a cylindrical shape and a reflective surface that catches the light. The tool, which is partially visible, appears to be made of a dark, possibly metallic material with a textured surface, suggesting it may be used for gripping or manipulating objects. The can's material allows it to be squeezed, as evidenced by the deformation of its surface, while the tool's material allows it to exert pressure, as seen in the action of puncturing the can. The interaction between the can and the tool is focused on the can's puncture, showcasing the material properties of both objects.
